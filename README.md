Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using CNN | TensorFlow & Keras

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built and trained in Google Colab to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras.
This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python certification.

Key Features:

Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and ImageDataGenerator

Trains a deep learning model on cats vs dogs dataset

Achieves image classification accuracy of around 70%+

Includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction visualization

Final output shows test images with confidence levels (“Cat — 93% sure”)
